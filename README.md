# Age_Clock_v2
A clock that accurately displays the age of a single human from ages 0 to 18. This is a fun trinket for kids to enjoy as they get older. At first, when the human is young, the clock will display the age in years and quarter years. Then,as the human gets a little bit older, the clock will display in units of years and months. Finally, at a certain age, the clock will display years, months, and days.

* The brain will be a Raspberry Pi Zero W. 
* The time will be update by signals recieved from a GPS reciever.
* The Year will be represented by a clock hand just like a standard wall clock driven by a stepper motor.
* The Month / Quarter Year and Day indicators will be represented by LEDs strips illumnating the same number of LEDs as the current quantity of those values.
